# Dungeon-Decisions2

Two players dropped into a dungeon/maze.
Inorder to leave the maze they need to find the exit.
Each player has it own keys for right left of forward.
Each turn they can have one step but they need to both agree on the direction or else a random direction is chosen for them.
Each turn is limited in amount of time.
